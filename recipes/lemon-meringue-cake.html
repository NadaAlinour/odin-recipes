  <ol class="list-container">
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
    <li>
      Make the crust: Mix cookie crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl
      until evenly combined; press into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make the filling: Beat cream cheese, sour cream, and sugar together in a
      bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, one at a
      time, beating well after each addition. Mix in lemon juice, lemon zest,
      and vanilla until smooth, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl as
      needed. Spread mixture over crust in the springform pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until almost set in the center, about 1 hour.
      Let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour, then refrigerate until
      completely cooled, at least 3 to 4 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>
      Make the meringue: Beat egg whites in a bowl with an electric mixer
      until soft peaks form. Beat in sugar and cream of tartar until mixture
      is glossy and stiff peaks form.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spread lemon curd over chilled cheesecake. Mound whipped egg whites over
      top and spread until curd is completely covered.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is golden brown, about 10
      minutes. Remove from the oven and chill, uncovered, in the refrigerator
      for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day before serving. Don't cover the
      meringue or it may collapse.
    </li>
  </ol>
