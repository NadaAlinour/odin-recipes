    <h4>Topping:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li><small>1/2</small> teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li>
        <li>Cream together butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in egg and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Add in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg, and mix until a dough just begins to form.</li>
        <li>Place dough into prepared pan. Using lightly floured hands, press dough firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon white sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Sprinkle evenly over the dough.</li>
        <li>Place pan into the preheated oven, and bake just until the dough in the center of the pan feels barely set, 20 to 23 minutes. Do not over bake.</li>
        <li>Allow cookies to cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Cut into 16 bars.</li>
    </ol>
